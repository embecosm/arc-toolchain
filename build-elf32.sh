# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:

#     ${ARC_GNU}/toolchain/build-elf32.sh [--force]

# --force

#     Blow away any old build sub-directories

# The directory in which we are invoked is the build directory, in which we
# find the unified source tree and in which all build directories are created.

# All other parameters are set by environment variables

# LOGDIR

#     Directory for all log files.

# ARC_GNU

#     The directory containing all the sources. If not set, this will default
#     to the directory containing this script.

# INSTALLDIR

#     The directory where the tool chain should be installed

# ARC_ENDIAN

#     "little" or "big"

# ELF32_DISABLE_MULTILIB

#     Either --enable-multilib or --disable-multilib to control the building
#     of multilibs.

# ISA_CPU

#     For use with the --with-cpu flag to specify the ISA. Can be arc700 or
#     arcem.

# DO_SIM

#     Either --sim or --no-sim to control whether we build and install the
#     CGEN simulator.

# CONFIG_EXTRA

#     Additional flags for use with configuration.

# CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET

#     Additional flags used when building the target libraries (e.g. for
#     compact libraries) picked up automatically by make. This variable is used
#     by configure scripts and make, and build-elf.sh doesn't do anything about
#     it explicitly.

# DO_PDF

#     Either --pdf or --no-pdf to control whether we build and install PDFs of
#     the user guides.

# PARALLEL

#     string "-j <jobs> -l <load>" to control parallel make.

# HOST_INSTALL

#     Make target prefix to install host application. Should be either
#     "install" or "install-strip".

# We source the script arc-init.sh to set up variables needed by the script
# and define a function to get to the configuration directory (which can be
# tricky under MinGW/MSYS environments).

# The script uses a build directory (bd-elf32[eb]) local to the directory in
# which it is executed.

# The script generates a date and time stamped log file in the logs directory.

# This version is modified to work with the source tree as organized in
# GitHub.

# Tag all the current HEADs of releases for testing.

# Usage:

#     ./tag-release.sh <tagname>

# For each repository, the branch chosen by arc-versions.sh will be tagged,
# and that branch MUST have an associated upstream.

# This does the following steps

#  1. Run arc-versions.sh to checkout the heads of all component trees

#  2. Tags and pushes the tag for all the component trees *except* toolchain.

#  3. Checks out arc-releases branch.

#  4. Merges arc-releases with -dev.

#  5. Edits arc-versions.sh so it checks out the tagged versions of all
#     components.

#  6. Commits this change, tags that commit and pushes that tag.

# At the end, the toolchain branch will be checked out on that tag. For
# ongoing development we'll need to checkout the dev branch.
